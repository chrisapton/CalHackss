We can treat all given names as a single \\nobject —for example,  “John  Paul.”  \\n• When a student takes a co urse, the year and semester he attempted it are \\nrecorded. When he finishes the course, a grade (such as A or B) and a mark (such as \\n60 percent) are recorded.  \\n• Each course in a program is sequenced into a year (for example, year 1) and a \\nsemester (for exampl e, semester 1).  \\n \\n2.

      "This homework assignment encompasses several key concepts related to data science and database management. The first part of the assignment deals with Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams, requiring students to create a comprehensive ER diagram based on a set of requirements for a university database. This involves understanding and representing entities such as students, courses, programs, and their interrelationships.\n",

Students are asked to analyze a given 'Store_Sales' table and determine whether it adheres to these forms. If it doesn't meet the 2nd Normal Form, students are tasked with restructuring the table accordingly.\n",
